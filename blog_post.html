                          <br>And here comes another one of my parchments in the series from last April or so. Note that this isn’t a rant about millennials rather just a piece of my own opinion and the issues I feel being introduced by the presiding millennial class of our society.
<br>
                          <h4>Why I hate Millennials ?</h4><br>
                          <p>
So, basically whom do we define as Millennials ? Adults who were born approximately in or after the year 1984 are collectively termed as ‘millennials’. Our nation, India is home to the largest number of millennials in the world. These young and dynamic minds have high hopes of achieving big on the global stage and are leaving no stones unturned in making a difference. However, most of these people are also struggling on various fronts in their lives.
With no answer in sight, a lot of them are becoming victims of depression and are even getting suicidal!
So, basically these are the people who are tough to manage and are constantly accused of being entitled. And narcissistic, unfocused, lazy… blah blah blah. But ‘entitled’ is the big one.
</p><p>
The problem right now is arising when the leaders are asking the millennials, “What do you want?”
And the answer comes right in, “We want to work in a place with purpose.” Or, “we want to make an IMPACT !” Whatever that means. And, “We want free food and bean bags.”
</p><p>
And that is THE PROBLEM. No one wants Job Security, Financial Stability, Economic Knowledge, etc.
They think life’s gonna be good just because they are leading a lavish life right now over being extravagant in a very easy manner with their father’s/mother’s hard earned wealth. Let them get into the real world. Let them realise how tough it is to even earn some proper 20,000 bucks on their own. Let them face hardships. It’s only when life will disappoint them, they’ll recall…

                        <p>Everybody is just typing on their cell phones. Nobody wants to interact. Or meet new people. We all know how much issue it is for a boy to properly approach a girl nowadays. They talk to women as if they are a goddamn alien race instead of treating them like normal humans. And that’s the problem. This is what technology is doing to ‘Millennials.’ To such an extent, I have seen boys even having an issue initiating a conversation with another man nowadays.
And we can’t even blame the Millennials because apparently, everything has been delivered to them on their fingertips now. You want food, just order it on the phones. You want a new dress, Flipkart it is.
You don’t have to make any efforts to approach a new person. Just swipe right on Tinder and Boom ! I’m the Shtud !
</p><p>We don’t care If you’re hot. We mostly certainly don’t. No one actually does. Because hot spelled backwards is ‘toh.’ And agar tu hot hai ‘Toh main naachu ?’
Just stop goddamnit. Look away from the cellphones and INTERACT !
</p><p>Do you people even realise that you are drowning in technology while starving for wisdom ?
And we can’t even blame the Millennials for it entirely. Because they have apparently been dealt in wrong hands by their parents, teachers, principals and other elders.
</p><p>I make this allegation because these are the people who have been spoon-feeding these millennials from the beginning, declaring that, “Go ahead, dream as much as you can.” Or, “You can have in life whatever you want.”
Dreaming and aiming high is fine and admissible. But you can’t aim for impossible things. I mean, yes, you can grab some philosophy and quotes and counter me on this. But life isn’t a philosophy. It’s practice.
</p><p>Seriously ? You can have it just because you want it ? This is the point where I think the elders and the so-called ‘teachers’ stand incorrect. Teach the children from the beginning itself, that they can’t have everything in life just because they want it.
You want to stop the violence against women ? You can’t seem to figure out how to teach your son to properly respect women ? I’ll tell you, don’t. Don’t teach him to respect women. Teach him to respect everybody.
Or you can’t seem to figure out how to teach him about ‘feminism’ with so much of mis-definitions floating around the internet about it. Here’s an easy way to do this. Write it on a piece of paper,
</p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
The idea of feminism is not supposed to be confused with confining women behind a lakshman rekha.</p>

                    <p>
                      and stick it on your son’s bedroom’s wall.
He might not get it when’s 5 years old. Or 10. Or 15. Or 25. But he’ll get it eventually when he’ll read the exact same thing written in front of him for years. There will come a time when he’ll reflect upon it. Question it. Deny it. Eventually he’ll know what it means.
</p><p>Because I personally believe that growing strong and well-minded children is easier than fixing broken men and women.
You can practically teach everything to your children with this simple method. They’ll get it eventually.
</p><p>Similarly write it on a piece of paper and stick it on their walls, “Zaroorat se zyada acha banoge, toh zaroorat se zyada chutiya katega.”
</p><p>Let them make girlfriends/boyfriends. Let them get into relationships. Let them know how to form RELATIONS. Don’t teach them to stay away from them. You and I would both agree on the fact that a man should learn and practice the thin fine line between flirting and harassing a woman. And a woman should be able to judge a man perfectly in this ugly-modern-world before one of them harms her in any way. But teach them not to cross the boundaries and not to break hearts.
</p><p>Dear millennials, you're so wonderful. You have so much of your life ahead of you. Why are you still stuck in the past? You deserve much more love than you think you do.
</p><p>When was the last time any of you wrote a letter to someone ? Writing and receiving letters is the practice I have ever witnessed. I still write letters to my girlfriend and she sends me back one. We might be connected with high speed internet aided Facebook/WhatsApp, but nothing beats the charm of reading a letter from someone. Just sit down. It might seem boring. But give it a try someday. It’s the best thing I have personally encountered. Why has this practice even disappeared as a cultural norm in the first place ? Seriously.
</p><p>Recently I invited a few local friends over to my place for a party. When I called one of them, he was like, “But why should I come over, you’ll be my only friend over there. I don’t know your other friends.”
</p><p>So what, mate ? Come over. Meet new people. Make new friends. INTERACT. Who knows you might even get laid.
</p><p>Yet he spent his entire time at my home sitting in an isolated area swiping his fingers to scroll down his Facebook news feed.
</p><p>I know you all have way too many friends. But how many of them would you dare to call at 3 in the night just because you need someone to talk to.
</p><p>Mere bhi bauhaut dost hai. Aur saare parmaanu bomb hai. But understand the point I’m trying to make.

  Really women, there’s a high chance that after marriage you’ll be one day standing in the kitchen preparing ‘chai’ for your pot-bellied husband, and mark my word, if this God forbidden day strikes your life, you’ll again reflect upon today and think maybe if I had ditched my ego or had a bit more audacity to message/meet a new man every week, I would have found a better pot-bellied man to prepare chai for.
</p><p>And my dear men, it’s an honest advice, no matter what you say/think, there’s a high chance one day you’ll get married and your wife is gonna get on your nerves. And you’ll think, maybe if I had only took a step further and messaged/met a random woman every week properly ditching the fear of being categorized as cheap/chaep/creepy or being seen-zoned, I would have found a better one.
</p><p>Yes, you will be categorized/assumed to be a creep/chaep or seen-zoned/ignored in today’s society. Because instances and experiences have moulded women to do it subconsciously without even properly giving you a fair chance to present yourself. But that’s perfectly fine. Everybody faces rejection. I did too. But trust me, it’s more than awesome to meet new people and hear them out. And not every woman will reject you. At least 1/10 will talk to you.
</p><p>This doesn’t just leave you with making a new friend. It will also teach you how to initiate conversations with random people. How to charm them. How to listen to them properly. How to communicate better. And also, carve you into a better human.
</p><p>Why you need to message women, you ask ? Or run behind them ? Because only a wise man knows that the most prized women need to be ran after. And admit it or not, we all are perverts in the end. It’s just lack of honesty which makes us saints.
</p><p>Moreover, texting women/men only isn’t what I’m talking about. Just find and contact any random person or maybe someone you aspire to be to fetch some great life advice from them. Or some senior from your college to learn something new from them. Or some graduate to know how they grabbed the huge package at that company.
Talk to them. Convince them. Fight them. Force them. Manipulate them. It’ll be tough at the beginning. But you’ll know how to get the job done. Kabhi Kabhi Zidd Karna seekh lo. Half your tensions will be gone.
</p><p>Fight with your girlfriend/boyfriend. Convince them. Cooperate. Gift them a flower or kiss them on the cheeks. You have to compromise. That’s how you maintain relations in life. Something you weren’t taught in school ? Give your partner another chance, man. Even the World War happened twice.
</p><p>You don’t have someone to tell all your life issues to? Not even your best friend ? Message me. Or call me. Or find someone new to talk to.
Just INTERACT ! Use your phone as a landmark technological invention and interact with the world. It’s not just used to share memes on the internet.
</p><p>Most importantly, if you write like, “Heya ! Hw r u gal ? u luk hot,” please ditch this RIGHT NOW. Like, at this very moment. I don’t know what school you go to, but…

</p>
  <ul>
                            <li>This isn’t proper English.
                            <li>To me, it doesn’t seem English at all.
</li>
                            <li>This is DEFINITELY not the correct way to impress ‘hot’ women.
</li>
<li> Stop calling women ‘hot.’ There is much better and proper vocabulary to use instead of the word ‘hot.’ Only Americans, being bankrupt of vocabulary themselves, do this. And that’s why they got Donald Trump.
</li>
<li>With this language, you might attract some bitches. But in order to impress a proper and elegant lady, PROPER GRAMMAR IS THE KEY.</li>

</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>NOTE: Refer to this thesaurus link for synonyms of ‘beautiful’: http://www.thesaurus.com/browse/bea...
You are welcome. I just made it more than 50% easier for you to impress women now.
</p><p>Unfortunately, I’m not the Chief Justice of India, otherwise mark my words I would have passed a landmark judgement saying, if your clothes cost more than your education then opening your mouth with an intention to speak the accused shall be charged with a death penalty.
</p><p>And to all the ladies reading this parchment, please just listen to men for once. Just. Listen. Don’t react. Just listen. Calm down and realise that #NotAllMen are the same. And even if you don’t wish to speak to someone, instead of friend-zoning(because boys seem to be too scared of this word nowadays) just…
</p><p>Tell him that haram relationships will take him to hell and you want to see him in heaven.
</p><p>JANNAH-ZONE him!
(Taken from Zubi Agha’s Timeline)
It’s so much better and sounds much ‘cooler.’
</p><p>And coming back to the millennials in general, I really don’t know how to put it in any better way, but what your parents, teachers and the principal have been trying to teach you by using the terms “manners” and “etiquettes,” all this while since kindergarten is that… </p>

  Millennials don’t get it what it means to grow up. Because all their life they have been lied to. You tell someone that they can have absolutely anything in life. And then suddenly one day they get into the real world with an engineering degree in one hand and absolutely no job in the other hand. That’s exactly what they go through.
</p><p>It’s almost like you teach someone to drive a car and never tell them about the harsh reality of experiencing an accident which can permanently end them.
</p><p>And coming to the most clichéd topic ever, YES marks matter. I don’t know why, but I don’t want you to fail just because of me. Elders need to STOP teaching their kids about pressing over marks. I haven’t ever understood this concept that how can 2 digits over a random sheet of paper, checked by a total stranger decide your entire life ahead ? I mean, then our teachers/parents must be Nirmal Baba type Gyanis or future foretellers or some voodoo fad shit like that. Am I wrong ?
</p><p>Many teachers and students, nowdays, in our schools adhere to what might be called a “Hidden Contract.” This Hidden Contract has been agreed to and reconfirmed by teachers and students since antiquity. It reigns in elementary school classrooms and collegiate lecture halls alike, and goes something like this…
</p><p>First, the student's responsibilities are to sit quietly, write down everything the teacher puts on the board, politely and frequently ask for points of clarification, and memorize their notes, summary review sheets, and text for the exam. They are required to do well on the exam as well as promptly forget everything that they obediently memorized last year. Students who break this contract by coming to class late, posing questions about the actual real-life relevance of the material, or failing to adequately memorize the material are considered to be troublemakers or unwilling to play the game of “school.”
</p><p>You want to teach them ? Teach them how to behave properly. How to trust others. How to betray others. How to connect with people. How to deduce whose fake and who might come off as a genuine friend. Teach them about what interests them. Let them raise questions and get curious. Teach them how to pay their taxes. Teach them how to protect their daughters/mothers/sisters in this harsh world. Teach them how to protect themselves when attacked by some hitman.
</p><p>Teach them how to make their way back home if they unfortunately get lost somewhere and their phone’s battery runs out. Teach them how to find a place to protect themselves in such a situation. Teach them about diplomacy and bureaucracy. Teach them how to ditch people and why they need to be evil sometimes. Teach them how in life they’ll have to doubt things/people they thought were entirely unquestionable. Teach them to stop being naive in this harsh world. Teach them how to cope up with depression and avoid suicidal thoughts. Teach them they don’t need to think wrong of themselves anytime or in any absolute manner because bhagwaan ne rishtedaar banaye hain uske liye.
 </p><p>Teach them it’s perfectly okay to fail. Teach them how Robert Downy Jr. once went to jail for substance abuse and is now one of the world’s greatest actors. Teach them to be financially stable. Teach them the benefits of economic stability. Teach them about the essence of a well-settled married life. Teach them how to stay quit and listen to their in-laws in order to get over with the lecture soon. Teach them to respect people of every religion.
</p><p>But who cares about all of this crap ? At least by the end of 12 years, I can find the area of a triangle using definite integrals. Correct ?
</p><p>I’m not necessarily saying it is entirely useless to learn this level of advanced mathematics, but what about the aforementioned things which need to be taught in the first place itself ? What happened to much better and valued books in life like the infamous Chanakya Neeti ? Is it any less ‘proper’ than your own press-printed books on human values taught to 3rd-5th standard students in your schools ?
</p><p>You wish to send your kids to good colleges ? Have you even ever sat down and calculated the Return of Investment(ROI) at the end of a 4 year term engineering course in a private college ? Does it in anyway pay back your lakhs of rupees spent in the end when your child won’t even probably have a job having his/her engineering degree in hand given the pathetic condition of our country’s engineering sector. Don’t you think he/she can actually earn more if they become a painter/actor/singer by their own choice ?
</p><p>Teach them that the only law they need to follow is the law of Humanity. And the only God they must worship is the God of Karma. We are living in 21st century and yet fighting over a superstitious concept like religion. Really, people ? Does being a Hindu/Muslim/Christian really make a difference ? You are still reciting Mahabharata/Ramayana books to your 7th & 8th Standard students, without realizing that the the crowd in front of your also consists a few Muslim and Christian students who don’t wish to study this. So, when aer you including sacred Islamic/Christian books in your syllabus ? You don’t want to ? Then remove these books as well.
</p><p>You want to battle this ? Just take a piece of paper and write the following lines and stick it in your children’s bedroom. Or maybe in yours too.

  Because I personally say that the day isn’t far whence Man and God shall encounter and both shall exclaim, “Look, My Creator!”
<p>Just imagine if you carried on believing in Santa and the Tooth Fairy even into your adulthood. And even killed and eventually enraged wars over it. Haha. Just imagine. Don’t speak. Just imagine.
</p><p>BE THE ELAICHI IN EVERYONE’S CHAI. NOT IN EVERYONE’S BIRYANI. HOW HARD IS IT TO GRASP ?
</p><p>What none of us millennials wish to accept is, we live in an emotionally week society. People take offense at everything including sex, violence, kissing in public but bastard-ously allowing peeing in public, religion and over getting paid more than your own best friend. Why can’t people just calm down ? You don’t like something ? Here’s what to do… IGNORE. MOVE ON. YOU ARE NOT COFFEE. NOT EVERYONE NEEDS YOU.
</p><p>You don’t agree with what I said ? Just grab me in a corner and politely correct me. Why won’t I Listen? I definitely will. Any sane man will.
</p><p>You wish to shout a rant or make a ruckus out of it, here’s the thing… hold your thumb and index finger together. Press it tight. That is how much I bloody care now !
</p><p>And seriously, all the cocaine in this world, and still your nose is in my business ?
</p><p>You want to do something better in your life ?</p>

<ul>
  <li>Message a new person telling them how amazing their display picture is. Just pay a compliment. And leave. They’ll come back to talk.
</li><li>Salute a policeman/policewoman/soldier you see on the road next time.
</li><li>Instead of just stopping your car at the signal to let the old guy pass through. Get out and help them walk faster.
</li><li>Let people get in before you in the metro. Doors won’t close so soon.
</li><li>Make your mother some chai. Buy your dad a new tie.
</li><li>Learn to dress well and smell well. Because personality ka toh sab randi-rona karte hai. Baat toh har kisi ne shakal dekh ke hi karni hoti hai.
</li><li>Watch TEDx or Curiosity or Insider videos.
</li><li>Read a new book.
</li><li>Sit with your grandparents in the warming sunlight in this dilli-ki-sardi and let them narrate their life experiences to you while breaking some peanuts. And click a bunch of selfies with your own grandparents.
</li><li>Go to a fish market and scream “What is this? A classroom?” Thereby maintaining the balance in the universe.
</li>
<p>
There you go bud. I just gave you 10 new things to do. It’s easy. Just get off that damn cell phone and INTERACT.
</p><p>We live in a society where people are sad. But not sad enough to become a singer/artist or whatever. But just sad. And they have no one to talk about it to.
</p><p>What everyone needs to do is just calm down. Just relax for a second. Just take a deep breath and get it into your head… Dekh lena hum sab ki zindagi main jo bhi hoga, thoda Late hoga but Latest hoga BC !
</p><p>And mind that courtesy, chivalry and elegance never fade away. Never forget the basic etiquettes.  Want a New Year’s Resolution which you can actually keep up with? Stop Abusing. Just control. It would be tough in the beginning but it’ll get easier. I am perfectly aware of the fact how the ‘fuck’ has gained so much popularity among teens nowadays that even for very basic issues and fundamental problems they so easily manage to scuttle this particular word out of their lips. It’s not proper. IT IS NOT.
</p><p>NOTE: The word ‘chutiya’ is completely out of the context here. Merely because it has grown upon us as not just a slang, but more like an emotion now.
</p><p>I have seen people abusing while they are angry. And they think it’s justified to abuse while they are fighting. No, mate. It just makes you lose the fight.
</p><p>I repeat, JUST RELAX AND CALM DOWN. The first one to abuse and the first one to raise their hand always loses first too.
</p><p>The key to winning the fight is to always keep calm and speak in a very low tone. It will always make your opponent angrier and they’ll eventually regret later. And that’s the point where you win the fight. You don’t win it when the fight is over.
</p><p>Our problem is that we tend to blame everyone for every other problem we encounter. The truth is that this world is full of monsters with friendly faces and angels full of scars. And we are one of them. But we won’t accept it. Because doing that might potentially kill us.
</p><p>Just sit down. Smile. Relax. And do something which makes you smile. Because no one lies on their deathbed thinking I should have worked in office until the dawn. Or I should have scored more marks in that exam.
</p><p>Go up to your mother and whisper in front of her eyes in a very creepy /scary manner…

  Do it until either you get it or she slaps the good 32 teeth out of your mouth.
</p><p>
Long story short, WE ALL MELLENNIALS need to grow a vagina (Yes, a vagina and not balls, because balls are weak and fragile. And vaginas can actually take a pounding.) and stop taking offense at everything. Because one day we all will depart on a journey free of cost. Don’t worry about the seat reservation, it is confirmed. The flight is always on time. Our good deeds will be our luggage. Humanity will be our passport. Love will be our visa. We just need to make sure we do out best to travel to Heaven in business class.
