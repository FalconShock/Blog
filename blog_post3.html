                        <p>It all started when I left for Chennai. My 18th year of being single once again.
</p><p>It' been 3 months since I left home. It' been 3 months since I found a new one.
</p><p>You all must be familiar with my series of notes since April or so. And here comes yet another. Many ask me why do I waste time writing these lengthy notes/posts. It’s simple. If you won’t be remembered after being dead or rotten, for the sake of a contingency either write things worth reading or do things worth being written about.
</p><p>But honestly I feel too odd, that I have all of this inside me. But to all of you, it’s just going to be some words you’ll forget as soon as you close this window.
</p><p>The voice you hear while reading this parchment isn’t me speaking. It’s my mind speaking.
</p><p>Before I proceed, let's just clear a couple of misconceptions about college life.
</p><p>Firstly, shoot your relative who says, "College life mast hai. Koi tension nahi."
</p><p>Secondly, if you are under false hood of the thought that just because you were able to do an 8am class in school for 12 years, you can continue the tradition in college too, let me say, “HaHa Sucker.” The truth is, you can't even do an 11 am lecture.
Thanks to one of my new Afghan friends who reminded me of the following wise words...
  <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Kabhi phoolon ki tarah mat jeena,<br>
        Jis din khiloge, bhikar jaoge.<br>
        Jeena hai toh pathar bankar jeeyo,<br>
        Jis din tarashe gaye, heera ban jaoge.”

</p><p>That’s right. I just found out that Afghans know about Bollywood more than we can ever do. And I mean it literally.

</p><p>While there’s probably not going to be any inspiration inside you to attend those boring and utterly useless lectures which renders you nothing better than dead-tired, luckily your college will provide you with an interesting fear of 75% attendance to make you grab yourself from bed at 7:45 and run like a bitch to the class by sharp 8.

</p><p>Moving on to your finally-financially-independent-life, most of the time your mood in college would be somewhat like, "Leave me Alone !" Other times, you'll be more like, "Leave me a Loan !" That's right you'll go broke. Major Broke !</p><p>
Being entirely honest, when I reached here, I hated every bit of this new life. Why ? Maybe because I chose my sorrows and joys of college from those cool-dude movies and shitty teenage late-night-thoughts about college life when my hormones were doing their thing ,years before I experienced them.
</p><p>In the defense of all boys studying in an engineering colleges which are mostly devoid of any girls, one thing I learned in Chennai from a friend of mine or somewhere I don’t exactly remember, if you are nervous or unable to approach your crush, the only possible way to do it is to sue her in court. She’ll be forced to see you in court, well dressed and in control. Let the Law be your wingman.
</p><p>And in the defense of all those women who mostly after surviving a month in an engineering college drop their standards low, I feel you. Standards as low as they begin wearing apple bottom jeans with fur boots. Plus, I perfectly understand why waste your best boob years on boys in engineering when they won’t even waste their one counter strike life to text you back.
</p><p>The smothering heat and Sun rays in Chennai demands no introduction.
</p><p>While girls will be busy protecting themselves with tons of makeup and expensive scarves over their heads, boys will go for tubes of protective sun screens.
</p><p>After your next 20 minutes outside the hostel, Sun over you will go like, "LOL ! Not for long, bitch."
</p><p>And your bathroom light will be like, "You look fab mate !"
</p><p>Before exams, some days you'll be turning to God. Some days, you'll be turning to Vodka/ Old Monk. But in both cases, you'll be guided by a spirit.
</p><p>"Phew..." for that.
</p><p>Surviving among people from different spans of the country, separate religions, yet with a common dream, a computer science bachelor like me soon absorbs the fact that religion is just another open source program where everyone claims their build is the official release. And hence, you soon happen to realize that writing your own code with snippets from every other build is much better than trying to understand other pre-compiled builds.
</p><p>During my alone times in college, when listening to Coke Studio Pakistan keeps me sane and calm, reading a few shayaris take some credit in helping me keep my arrow of aim straight.
  <blockquote>
      <p>
        “Khud ko kar buland itna,<br>
        Ki har taqdeer se pehle,<br>
        Khuda bhi tujhse ye puche,<br>
        Ki bata teri raza kya hai ?”

</p><p>Also, amongst all of this hullabaloo many voices on the phone tried to call me back to Delhi. Suggesting me not to continue this life. But I’m thankful to god for all those mediocre minds. Which help me set myself apart. For if everyone had seen the Apple fall. The world would have faced chaos and brawls.
</p><p>If you expect me to break into some sort of musical asking you not to shed any tears for me or voice a huge applaud, then you’re barking up the wrong tree. Because I already made this clear in my earlier posts that though I have a beautiful voice, I do not possess Eva Peron’s range.
</p><p>More or less your life in college miles away here in Chennai from a city as happening as Delhi, will be like a romantic comedy, except there won’t be any romance and you'll be laughing at your own jokes.
</p><p>Although, being 2300km away from home, friends and family and most importantly Delhi, has changed a significant amount of me, not everything has been flipped. I still do MUNs in Chennai. Though I’m not allowed to use those casual flirtatious lines in MUNs, like “If you were a topic I’d table you on the spot,” college MUNs are way more debatable. So, everything is good.
</p><p>For everyone who’s still confused about what actually HAPPENS in engineering or the placements at the corner of it. Know that it’s more like the world of advertisement nowadays, where you can’t differentiate between a mango drink ad, a deodorant ad, a condom ad and a body lotion ad. Similarly, our placements see bachelors of Computer Science Eng., Software Eng. as well as IT Eng. along with other Electrical Eng. chaps sitting for the same jobs which require nothing apart from them to work on Microsoft Word/Excel. Because needless to mention, India seems to be running the software of tomorrow on the hardware of yesterday.
</p><p>Note: This isn’t true in all cases. Major product companies like Amazon, Cisco, Google, Sizzler, etc. make you work your sweat off. And placements are extremely tough for them.
</p><p>Many still wonder why do I continue this life. I do too. But it’s just something about this damn tough life which keeps me addicted. There’s something about that first day in Chennai. When I didn’t know anybody. It was like somebody had pressed the reset button for me for the first time. And I’d to build my life all the way from scratch.
</p><p>For a heavy sleeper like me who couldn’t stay awake for more than 12 hours a day earlier, to only sleeping 2 hours in a day during week days, surviving this was tough. Indeed, tough in the beginning. Especially for me since I had some trouble finding a room in the hostel. And eventually ended up sleeping at my friend’s house.  Life became so tough and busy that my friends & family began complaining for not attending their calls or messages for weeks. This life is teaching me all. If you can’t deal with it. It’s Simple. Turn a blind eye to it and go for a better and easy life back in your hometown. Just like you do to poverty, patriarchy, sexism, child labour and racism. But if you can stand it off, then also don’t set yourself on fire just trying to keep others warm.
</p><p>Amongst all of this, there are things which keeps our lives spiced. From surviving college from 7:30 to 4. Then abiding by orders from technical leads at separate clubs and to attending their meetings until 8. From entering my hostel room at 9 in the night to having few chats with friends.
</p><p>Because I can honestly admit that no matter how much fun I’ve had in my life, these 3 months of dreadfully-terrifying life were indeed the most amazing ones until yet. For I have never lived in the same hostel, just rooms apart from Kashmiris, Afghans, Nigerians, Americans, Tamils, Gujratis, Bengalis, Sindhis, Nepalese, Telegus, Bhutanese, students from Andaman & Nicobar and people of other ethnicities at the same time in my entire goddamn life.
</p><p>I have realized that you will fail exams. You’ll fail a lot of them. But soon you’ll realize that these memories are not even remotely as priceless as compared to any damn exam. From partying at friend’s places until 5 in the morning to threatening others to make my Engineering Graphics charts. From being devoid of any sleep for 2-3 days at stretch to hating my Tamil teachers who just continue to shout at a very high pitch aiming to blow up our ear drums someday.
</p><p>Nor have I ever before helped a friend entirely on phone to get him to Bangalore when he somehow woke up in a train in Western Ghats en route to Gangtok, where everybody spoke some language we never heard before.  Crazy, right ? You don’t know the half of it. That’s where this new family of friends comes in. When you are stranded in such a possibly life threatening situation but still you decide not to inform your parents. That’s when you call your friends. Your new family.
</p><p>Yes, we have a family here too. It’s not our parents, but our fresh friends. Needless to say, if something happens we avoid informing our family, to protect them from facing any sleepless nights because of us. And there we’re. Attending our friends at all needs. From taking care of them while they’re hospitalized or standing behind them at one call if they run into some sort of gang-fight with others at college.
</p><p>Believe it or not, I actually carried a friend of mine once, when he got brutally injured in a gang-fight outside college, in a shopping cart all the way up to hospital. Sounds funny, but in my defense, pushing a 90 kg shopping cart for 1.2 km isn’t that easy.
</p><p>And even if I did, I definitely not had those long fun sleepovers with them the night before our exams. From racially discriminating each other and laughing together on how we all are going to fail together in the next exam to casually teaching each other slang words in different languages. These moments are not even remotely close to being describable.
</p><p>Being this long away from what used to be your entire life once, taught me a hell lot of hard life lessons which my friends at home are probably going to learn very late in life than me. I learned how to financially manage myself without demanding more money from my parents. I know how to crash myself at the end of every month when my pocket runs out.  I learned how to save money by travelling in risky local trains than taking taxis every time.
</p><p>I learned while hanging out with so many women of separate ages and different ethnicities that we must not confuse our idea of feminism with confining women behind a lakshman rekha. I learned how to go out of my way to help others. I learned to easily figure out who’s a fake and who’s a keeper. I learned how to initiate conversations with totally random people in just a puff. To such an extent, if you put me in a circle of totally unknown people, chances are I might just not make all of them my friend, but make all of them each other’s friend.
</p><p>You start understanding everyone’s psyche. You learn how to deal with bullies. You learn how to make friends. You learn whom to make friends with. You learn how to deceive others. You are going to lose weight. Lose a lot of weight because of so much activity in your regular life. You learn how to get the job done when nobody’s helping you out. And most importantly how to ask for directions in a place where nobody knows you or speaks your language or to an extent see you as some sort of a white alien from another planet, at 10 in the night so that you can reach back home safely.
</p><p>I can say that I’m better than before for I’ve learned that my body is built from the same elements the bodies of lions are built. Three quarters of me is the same kind of water that beats the rocks to the rubble and wears the stones away.
</p><p>Among many other things I learned in this 3-month independent life also includes an extremely important lesson I learned the hard way. People will come and go. Some are like cigarette breaks and others are like forest fires. But never blame someone for leaving you. For everyone you’ll meet is fighting some kind of battle you know abso-fricking-lutely nothing about.
</p><p>Because I’ve found something that I love. Hence, I’ve no problem in letting it kill me. Because I’ve accepted the fact that this world isn’t a wish granting factory.
</p><p>Long story short, you’ll hate it until you rip the Band-Aid off. That’s when everything becomes just fine once again. And then you start loving that itchy feeling of healing when your wound is exposed to air. That’s it. That’s the thing I’m talking about.
