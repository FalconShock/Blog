                        <p>
                          Some words I wrote for the CBSE;
<blockquote>
Wo crush bhala kya crush hua Jo apni teacher par na kar gaye hum,<br>
Aur wo kaam bhala kya kaam hua ki ek aur masoom ki zindagi tod de hum.
</blockquote>
</p><p>Before I begin my babbling, my ardent and back-slapping congratulations to every pass out for getting into their dream colleges. And for those who couldn’t get into colleges, even big congratulations to all ya, since you’ll be in better colleges than us come 2017.
</p><p>It’s a universally acknowledged truth that no matter how smart/knowledgeable you are; you won’t fetch good marks in your boards should you not literally Xerox your answers from an invisible NCERT lying in front of you during the exam. Even if it’s mostly wrong. But who cares? We need marks.
</p><p>Yes, indeed, my fight is with CBSE. Just like any other student of the country. I’m no different. But I couldn’t tone down the topic of this note from using the F-Word. I tried. But this time there wasn’t any other word I found more apt to describe the CBSE’s gullible attitude.
</p><p>Who am I? I was just another aspiring CBSE student who worked hard to reach the top of the score board in Class XII Annual Board Examinations. I remember Halina Ma’am constantly nagging me, “Mrinal, don’t you dare write something which the examiner is oblivious of. They aren’t that smart. It won’t fetch you marks.” And that’s what I did. I followed my Guru’s instructions step by step and wrote my Computer Science paper in layman terms. And that too with comments. Any CS student would know how it feels to write comments in your code.
</p><p>So, we (Me and my batch mates) wrote our CS paper for the Python Programming Language this year. Mostly schools of our country have been teaching C++ & Java since decades, hence even the board examiners are trained in those languages. Python is new. Hence, discrepancies in the evaluations were expected. What not expected was, CBSE not accepting its mistake and gambling with our lives.
</p><p>As expected, all of us received 70s in CS, amongst the hullabaloo of our result day. Relatives constantly nagging us about our marks. Some comparing us with their kids and others sympathizing with us, “Beta, don’t feel bad about your CS marks. Hota Hai. Bura lag raha hai kya ?”
  <blockquote>
    “Nahi. Bilkul bura nahi lag raha Aunty. I am on local anesthesia. Bura kese lagega ?”
  </blockquote></p><p>What’s on the platter for us now ? File for revaluation and obtain the photocopies of our answer sheets. So we did. Abided by the protocol like good citizenry even if our sarkari afsars don’t. Halina Ma’am checked the photocopy. Outcome ? No one’s getting below 90. And awarded how much ? Not too low. Just in some 70s. A clear difference of 4-5%. DU aspirants would sympathize with us here, I’m sure.
</p><p>Discrepancies as silly as awarding marks out of 90 in a 70 marks paper were made followed by a MF Hussain ishtyle signature of the examiner in the end. (Contact me for the Image.)

</p><p>Furious us, being typical Delhiites, “Aaj toh Phod denge BC,” we reached the CBSE HQ at Preet Vihar. After much insisting, fighting and emotional attyachar in the smothering heat, fortunately we received a satisfactory response and they agreed to get our answer sheets revaluated in Dehradun.
</p><p>Pro Tip: All Computer Science students in NCR schools, kindly opt for a 6th subject immediately. I STRONGLY ADVICE IT.
</p><p><b>*Fast Forward 2 Weeks Later*</b>
</p><p>Our inboxes pinged. We went through the mail. Marks have been increased. What ? Seriously? Yes, they increased the marks. How much ? 4-8 marks for everyone.
</p><p><b>*Awkward Silence*</b>
</p><p>I have one question, is awarding 5 marks when a 20 marks incrementation is deserved, ethically & morally correct ?
</p><p>What to do next ? The CBSE HQ, once again. In their defense, I really liked their lawn though. No matter how shitty the people were.
</p><p>What happened there ? It went well. Just like a typical Bollywood-Sarkari-Office, they gave us a number to contact. And we did. Then we got another number. And then another. And yet another. And it went on and on. Standing in smothering heat once again for 2 hours, we contemplated life, how that Chole-Bhature wala beside the CBSE office is happier than us right now. And who knows ? He might even be in the near future, considering we are going for engineering.
</p><p>The outcome ? Nothing. We kept dialing numbers from the lowest level officer all the way to CBSE’s Secretary. Some never picked up the phone, others gave us new numbers. Until one badass lady picked up the call.
</p><p>And there she was, the so-called Deputy Secretary, easily speaking while consuming a samosa from her Air Conditioned Office, “Beta, ab kuch nahi ho sakta. Ab bhul jao !”
</p><p>Furious Me and Shashwat, being typical Delhiites once again, “Human Resources main phone laga BC.” Fine. Ye bhi try kar lete hain. That’s the only contingency left after all.
  <blockquote>
    “Bolenge kya Human Resources main ?”<br>
    “Violation of Right to Education !”<br>
    <b>*Human Resouces*</b><br>
    “Beta, CBSE is very smart, they made you sign a declaration long ago stating that you can’t re-challenge them. So, even the MHR can’t help you now. My advice is, forget the fight and seek admission in a good college in whatever subject you are receiving.”
<br>

  </blockquote>
</p><p>And there we stood. Blank. Sweating like hell. When I say to Shashwat, “Bhai, ek coke hi pila de yaar. Pyaas lag rahi hai !”
</p><p>Yes ! That is what happened. That’s how CBSE very easily tricked us into it’s monkey business. That’s how CBSE plays with lives. Why are you teaching subjects which you aren’t even prepared to properly evaluate ? Why destroy lives ? What about our future ? What about the fact that we couldn’t apply for many colleges just because of our CS marks ? Who’s going to compensate for that ? What about our dreams of getting a good CS college ? They just crushed it like an ant. Like it was nothing. Just… Boom !
</p><p>If you expect me to break into some sort of musical asking you not to shed any tears for me, then you’re barking up the wrong tree. Though I have a beautiful voice, I do not possess Eva Peron’s range.
<blockquote>I hereby say, the CBSE is the most insane institution of the country. It teaches us to worship an invisible God while it itself slaughters visible lives. Without realizing that the visible life they slaughter is the invisible God they worship.
</blockquote>
</p><p>But seriously, if you’re a dumbass, please get a formal education. This will not make you any less of a dumbass, but at least you’ll get paid to be one. This is why people get an MBA.
I’ll tell you a dark secret about our government. Basically, every time some technocrat with a vague connection to the Education Ministry walks in spewing fancy jargon and wearing a Brooks Brothers suit, they anoint him as the last remaining saviour of the Indian Education. CBSE is full of gullible idiots who will fall for anyone with a handsome face and a mildly foreign accent. Just because someone can say “education reforms” in Queen’s English does not mean they know what they’re doing.
</p><p><i>I was often tagged by the school authorities for being too blunt. Hence in my blunt voice to the CBSE, don’t you ever forget that we students are the effin’ future of the country. We’re hell smarter than you. We’re the demons of Exam writing. We eat crony examiners for breakfast. We’re the Meryl Streep of algorithmic programming. The Idris Elba of networking. The Harry Styles of computers. Worship us. Seek our wise counsel to bring back the education from the ninth circle of hell. Lie down at our feet in the hope that some intelligence rubs off on you. But don’t cross our paths.
</i></p><p>We were smart enough not to care about our marks because there’s the cliché that isn’t repeated often enough. It’s something that needs to be hammered into your heads, regardless of result, i.e. these marks, much like KRK’s opinion in India, do not matter. Or rather, they’ll cease to matter soon enough. Similarly, all of you also stop caring about the marks. Work Hard. That’s all. But only for yourself. Because no one else gives a crap about it. Not even the CBSE now, I guess.
</p><p>Because in the end, you’ll all just end up in good colleges and begin to discover your true self through Red Label, Old Monk, THC and Snapchats of your nether regions.
</p><p>Remember the old joke about a plane about to crash in which there were more people than the number of parachutes? Well, right now, the Indian Education is that plane. The members of CBSE are its passengers. And we’re the students who’re going to jump out with all the parachutes.
</p><p>

  Some lines I wrote for the CBSE standing at the HQ at Preet Vihar;<br>
  <blockquote>
        Ye CBSE ha janaab,<br>
        Yahan sab kuch bikta hai,<br>
        Zara rehna sambhal ke.<br>
        Ye log zindagiyaan bhi bech dete hain,<br>
