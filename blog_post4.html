                        <p>
                          Before you proceed with this parchment I want you to learn that no bastard ever brought about a phenomenal change over night with just words and no intentions. So, I might be writing this to pen down my lately-darked opinion of MUNs, but I nowhere intend to pose myself as some sort of revolutionary seeking uninvited attention, because I know that's the first thing which popped in the minds of conventional MUNners when they read my headline.
</p><p>I was in Delhi. I did MUNs. What do you think ? Yes, I had relationships. And from whatever I have learned, every relationship goes through three stages.
</p><p>Stage one is the moon landing stage: You meet someone new, someone utterly fascinating.
</p><p>You’re smitten, bitten by a bug, transfixed  —  it feels like landing on a moon after having slogged through the boring routine of Earth your whole life.
</p><p>Stage two is the false promises stage: You delude the other person, and yourself, into believing that things have permanently changed.
</p><p>The future feels warm and predictable now – and the two of you are in charge. Promises and plans run galore.
</p><p>Stage three is when shit hits the fan, when reality cracks down like a whip, when love fizzles out without much of a fight.  People are finite beings and they eventually become boring. Slowly, you drift apart from the one you couldn’t get enough of.
</p><p>I think I have reached stage three in my relationship with Model United Nations (MUN) conferences.
</p><p>I’ve attended 15 MUNs, 4 Youth Parliaments and other debating conferences . Out of the 21 conferences, I’ve also chaired some MUNs. My CV isn’t jaw dropping, but it is significant enough. I’ve attended conferences in Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai. I have met hundreds of debaters. From 13-year-olds yet to reach puberty to 23-year-old graduates who can’t get enough, from first time delegates overwhelmed by protocol to Executive Board members who smoke up at the end of Day 1 and go through Day 2 stoned  —  I’ve met, fought with and gotten to know people from all across the spectrum.
</p><p>Not everything was bad. Amongst many things I did meet some very classy people and especially women with a kickass attitude. That's when I understood, the rivers in India bear the neams of the fallen women exiled from Earth, for the heaven found them too hot to handle.
</p><p>And for some time, I thought it is the people who are the problem. I bought into this idea that there is a specific type of people who are sucked into the MUN orbit. The arrogant, opinionated, acronym spewing kind. I am arrogant and opinionated myself – although I abhor acronyms – and I thought if only we could do it differently, if only we could invent a new form of MUNning, it would be okay.
</p><p>I was wrong. People can do things differently (for instance, can we have more girls in the Security Council, please?), but they are not the fundamental problem. The fundamental problem is the thing in itself.
</p><p>Initially, I thought MUNs were perfect. I’ve always loved debating, so I took to it like the proverbial duck to water. Add to that the adrenaline from lobbying, the endorphin from flirting, the dopamine from winning, and I was near ecstatic. It was like being high without losing control. It couldn’t have been better.
</p><p>But because it was this goddamn good, Murphy's Law screwed me, and it got worse.
</p><p>By my fifth conference, I realised something was wrong. Things felt rushed inside the committee, the debating experience was getting unsatisfactory, and ever so steadily, I was starting to resent the other delegates. I had touched upon a flaw, bumped into an imperfection and brushed my hand against a tear in the fabric. Initially, I couldn’t quite understand what was wrong. I was winning, hoarding trophies, enjoying my committee time and the socials afterwards. There was nothing to complain  but something had twisted in my gut. My unbridled passion was getting diluted with cynicism.
</p><p>And for everyone who kept asking me, No. "If your placard is that long, meet me at the bathroom," is indeed not a good indicative pick up line for MUNs. Don't pull that stunt. For all I know you'll end up waiting in the washroom alone whilst the council shall be adjourned.
</p><p>And in defense of all the Men doing MUNs, there are several reasons to date us. For example, we have well-developed oral skills. We never finish early. We can flip sides yet be equally attractive. We like to go fast. We do it standing up and love it. And most importantly we like to be on the top. Need I say more ?
</p><p>By my sixth conference, I realised what was wrong. It was the way I was debating.
</p><p>In an MUN, you get a lot of chances to speak  –  but never for more than 2 minutes. I realised that I was selectively quoting facts, using linguistic flourishes to mock other viewpoints into insignificance, lobbying over imaginary differences and drafting hollow draft resolutions. I was, I realised, betraying my own research. Issues are complicated, more so the issues of international diplomacy, and if all you have are short bursts of 120 seconds, then rhetoric takes precedence over facts. Discussion of nuances is lost under the cacophony of ideological posturing.
</p><p>I decided to change. I couldn’t.
</p><p>I realised that it wasn’t just about me. I wish it was. But it was about the MUNs themselves. MUNs are not better, because they can’t be better. If people are going to be marked on how hard they lobby, on how much sarcasm they can stuff inside two minutes, and how many disjointed statistics they can spat out  —  then that’s what they’ll do. They’ll lobby hard and turn in a document full of nonsense and vague diplomacy that says nothing. They’ll make sarcastic remarks and feel all warm inside. They’ll rattle off figures and acronyms – mistaking fast-talking with genuine insight. And that's the problem I'm talking about.
</p><p>Whilst this just composes the base of the issues, other lame additions to the world of MUNs have furthure agravated the proble. Alpha, every nob is now a chair. Remember the delegate who actually slept the entire conference? Well guess what? He has decided to organize his own MUN and chair it. Boo-Yea haters!
</p><p>I don't know the rules, so I will just use the "Chair's Discretion." Chairing is no longer something reserved for the qualified. No sir. Just imagine, you show up at a conference expecting to learn about the world and about the intricacies of global diplomacy by someone who is as immature as you are. Really?
</p><p>Also if you haven't received the memo yet, I'll just update you. United Nations has finally decided to dissolve all the General Assembly Committees (GA) and replace them with the following:
<ul>
  <li>Super Heroes Summit (SHS)</li>
<li>Council of Elders (CE)</li>
<li>Christmas Party Planning Committee (CPPC)</li>
<li>Bar Mitzvah Celebration Council (BMCC)</li>
<li>Let’s Make Up Something To Sound Cool Committee (LMUSTSCC)</li>
<li>Game of Thrones Committee(GoTC)</li>
<li>Marvel Vs. DC (MVD)</li>
<li>Convention On How To Fool Kids And Steal Their Candy (CODHTFKSTC)</li>
</ul>
</p><p>Yes, non-conventional councils are good and interesting and they indeed attract quality talent. But only the ones with sensibly designed mandates like, the Formation of the USSR, The Chernobyl Accident, The trail of Adolph Eichman, et cetera. Not the aforementioned crap.
</p><p>What's with the Secretariat Exchange Program ?
<blockquote>

      “I promise to invite you as a chair if you let me chair at your conference since I know perfectly well that merit will never allow me to become a chair so please."

</blockquote></p><p>I totally admit that it's a good way of developing contacts with well experienced and talented people, but it's sort of getting brutal now.
</p><p>MUNs are screwed up because their incentive structure is screwed up. Beyond all the fancy formals and research binders, there lies the same old group-think, the extravagant prize money and the need to conform. The worst parts of our generation, the most disgraceful and absurd elements of 21st century, have made it deep inside MUNs. Offense is taken, apologies are demanded, platitudes are spoken and stereotypes are reinforced. Instead of a commitment to facts, we have role-playing. Instead of aggressive brew of opinions, we have plastic heads smashing into each other. And the new admissions to the precious board of Executives might look like one of the best ever, but you soon realise that had they been Karate instructors, their career is entirely unqualified and they just enjoy kicking children.
</p><p>I know these issues may not be as systematic as they might have come off from my article, but any vivid MUNner would agree that these issues are in fact true to a large extent.
</p><p>I have my next MUN conference at SRM University in February. It’ll perhaps be my last.  The chairs will be one of the biggest names in India, and the committee will almost certainly have the best debates in the conference. Maybe my love for MUNs will be rekindled.
</p><p>It was a good run. I remain as interested as ever in public debating. I remain as obsessed, if not more, about issues I’ve butted heads for. Above all, I retain my deep love for meeting interesting people and talking about world politics with them. But MUNs have slipped from fascinating to farce, and while it’s any fun, I think I’m going to wave farewell.
