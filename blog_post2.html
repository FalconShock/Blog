And for all the men, this post isn't exactly a man's-guide on how to beat feminism, it's more of a relational post from one man to another, sharing the insides of a man's life in 21st century and humbly saying, you aren't alone. I'm with you. So are the others.
</p><p>
</p><p>
  Pro Tip: A few rules to properly wearing a suit like an actual gentleman.  http://www.scoopwhoop.com/suit-tips...
</p><p>
  This post isn't exactly an anti-feminist frustration post on how all of us men wish there had been no feminism, but it's more like me asking all of you fine men to calm down and telling you everything is fine.
</p><p>
  Feminism is good. Especially for women. And of course, why not. Women are the ones who have always sort of lived under a diktat. Told to wear, told to keep quiet, told to talk, told to dress up, told to dress down, told to be brave, told to be complacent, told to live, told to die on the piers on dead husbands, told to stay away from school, told to be the sole bread earner, told to leave, told to stay….the list goes on. Has anything been their choice?
</p><p>
  The subtleness of the abuse has got a lot of us angry. Especially, women. They required feminism. And so did we.
</p><p>
  But I also admit amidst this hullabaloo of feminism, there had been a rise against anti-masculinism. I don't want to spark another debate on how our justice system has horrendously given full autonomy and unjust powers to women of our country and outside too. We already know that. I understand. All us men do.
</p><p>
  For example, if the death of the woman is caused by burns or bodily injury within 7 years of marriage, it's the husband's fault. This has been stated in Section 304 B of the Indian Penal Code. No matter what the actual reason of the accident might be.
</p><p>
  Or, let's say, According to Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code , if the husband commits adultery with the wife of another man, he can be prosecuted for the same. But if a woman commits adultery with the husband of another woman, she cannot be prosecuted.
</p><p>
  Also, we know if we spoke out for it, no one would listen to us and just simply tag us with one of those feminazi insults. Because, hell we are men. And empowerment is only meant for women in this country. So, I'm just asking you to calm down and bring a smile on your face. That's it. I’m proud of being a man and I’m pretty sure, so are you.
</p><p>
  You all perfectly understand the default "insult", routinely deployed towards any guy who even remotely questions feminist ideology or any special treatment of women is the tag of a "misogynist." You can be a misogynist for most things these days, from pointing out the gender pay gap isn’t real to saying men’s football is better than women’s. Note: women can’t be misogynists (nor sexist), just as black people can’t be racist. It’s a boys-only club.
</p><p>
  See. I understand. All us men do. You are not alone.
</p><p>
  Or for the sake of the fun, let's say, a cisgendered man is a man who isn’t transgender, meaning the vast majority of mankind. This means you cannot possibly understand the plight of the other 50 genders out there, from genderqueers and pangenders to fully-formed transgenders. To be “cis-white” also means you can’t understand racism. You’re the lowest of the low.
</p><p>
  A ‘f**kboy’ is a young man who sleeps with women without any intention of having a relationship with them. Which is a lot of men. They’re dismissed as Tinder-driven, callous womanizers, emotional vampires and losers, even though lots of women have sex with them – which is what really infuriates the feminists.  But obviously, women are the most endangered form of species on the planet, so no such insulting words for them.
</p><p>
  Do you all remember when about an year ago, the infamous Priyanka Chopra exclaimed on international media, "I don't need men other than for children." Or when Deepika Padukone released that bad-ass feminist video wherein she said, "To sleep or not to sleep out of marriage is my own choice."
</p><p>
  Imagine a man saying that. Period.
</p><p>
  I am not going against women for categorizing all men as rapists or ass-holes. But I also know, no one would listen to us even if we begged them not to do it. Because, we don't exactly have an empowerment movement for us.
</p><p>
  It’s okay if a woman wanted to show up A little bit of skin and that indeed is no sin. But what when that little equals objectification over sexualisation which causes one hell of a sensation. I mean enough with the overgeneralization.
</p><p>
  I say, men and women can never be equal. We were not meant to be equal. Men are better than women in certain things. Just like women are better than men at certain other tasks.
</p><p>
  Pro Tip: Ladies dig confidence. And confidence is sexy as hell. But Cockiness is not. Period.
</p><p>
  Like, there has been a life long debate on whether women are physically stronger or men. The thing is how do we explain the simple fact that men are indeed to these feminist women who have already been brainwashed. Yes, some women are stronger than some men. But why does everything have to be generic ? Men are physically stronger in most times. It's proven by biology. And you can't fight biology.
</p><p>
  It's exactly like women are better multitaskers than men because their brains have been programmed to. And ours aren't.And the point is, we aren't ashamed of admitting this. In fact, we are totally cool with it.
</p><p>
  Also, if you ever feel totally useless about getting friend-zoned or bro-zoned from a woman, don't worry. Just remember 500 years ago, the Australian army attacked itself and lost 10,000 men. You are not useless yet, mate !
</p><p>
  And also, just for the sake of it, once the Roman Emperor Caligula waged a war against Poseidon. And he had his army walk to the beach and start stabbing the water. YOU ARE NOT USELESS, MATE!
</p><p>
  I know, we hear about such useless debates all around the world day by day and we can't speak because hell, we are men and who would listen to us. See. I understand all of it. And I'm pretty sure, you do too. So, just smile and calm down. Because we are men. One more thing we are better than women at is not complaining and shouting. And I'm proud of it.
</p><p>
  Pro Tip: Here's a link on how to properly pick lingerie for your girlfriend. Cheers !  http://www.storypick.com/lingerie-man/
</p><p>
  Of course women should be allowed to earn as much as a man, it's their goddamn right as a human. Not just as a women. But O' ya all fine gentlemen, you are going to meet various women in life. Some will even promise to stay with you in all times of distress until the point you promise to be her knight in shining armour. But take my advice and never marry a girl until you are financially stable and ready to buy her a Castle in France. Like, hell yeah, she has promised to stay with you if god forbid any unforeseen circumstances strike you in the future. But even if she earns a lot of wealth herself as an independent and emotionally strong woman, never assume that wealth to be yours. But always let her have your wealth (Only after you are comfortable with her using it to buy some puppies.) But anyway, I really don't see the reason to deliberately drag someone else's daughter into poverty because she made a mere promise.
</p><p>
  Because, I'm pretty sure, no matter how much your own daughter's future husband might love her, you wouldn't want to her to go from a lavish life straight to poverty.
</p><p>
  But my main motive of this post is to urge all of you to not get frustrated by such anti-masculinist feminism, that you just stop being fine gentlemen and lose your subtle manners and classic etiquettes and your utmost respect for women. Because, I have seen a lot of men doing that lately.  Never ever lose your respect for women. Go ahead, flirt with her. Make her dazzle. Do it until she bites her lips. But before you cross the line and go overboard,  remember you are talking to someone else’s daughter. And maintain the goddamn eye contact with her.
</p><p>
  Dating Tip: Talk to women as humans. Many men approach women as if they are a goddamn alien race.
</p><p>
  I’m not saying necessarily for all women, but your  high levels of intelligence do have a really pornographic effect on some women.
</p><p>
  But being a man in India is arduous and we men know it very well. And it's not that I'm scared of women, but whenever it comes to feminism I immediately exit the chamber and voluntarily walk out of the debate. Because I do have a feeling that women won't understand all this if we tried to explain. So, logically it's a waste of energy for us men.
</p><p>
  We are men. We have been doing this for centuries. Be subtle. Be discreet. Be the prince of her princess. Be the gangsta and get the job done. But without making any noise. After all, there's been a reason, we men haven't felt the need to go out on the roads and get ourselves heard. Or actually create a hullabaloo by having a ruckus about why there were no emotional or ‘empowering’ posts for men on the recent International Men’s Day. Or why didn’t some famous celebrity dropped an amazing quote for us on this amazing occasion. Or why didn’t Google dedicate a Doodle for us. Because, we simply don't want to and neither do we care about it.
</p><p>
  And I know it's totally unrelated, but... Do you know the cream that women use to remove hair from their leg. Just don't use it for your parts, man. Trust me. Just don't.
</p><p>
  Also unrelated, but if you really need an amazing book to read, go for the Chanakya Neeti. You’ll thank me later.
</p><p>
  Pro Tip: Never let the little head do the thinking for the bigger head.
</p><p>
  Be the elaichi to her chai. Not her biryani. I understand your frustration.
</p><p>
  Pro Tip 2514561651: Never have sex with any woman who doesn't want it as much as you.
</p><p>
  Pro Tip 6544654654: Always stand to greet a woman. In fact, to greet anyone.
</p><p>
  Pro Tip 4655161556: Never argue with her when she's PMSing. Abort the Mission !
</p><p>
  But hey you, utter gentleman, do you know the basic difference between a clitoris and a golf ball ? A golf ball is actually worth looking for.
</p><p>
  Yup. I know, I'm savage. And I also know my inbox is going to be flooded with feminist messages as soon as I release this parchment. But again, I can't exactly explain women that I have no hard feelings for feminism or their movement. I'm talking to you all men, and I'm telling you that it's all fine and we don't have a problem even among all this ruckus. So just continue being fine gentlemen and complete your jobs discreetly.

  Let's just pretend I never said this, but despite everything, you need a girlfriend, my man. Remember, Neil didn't have a girlfriend. Isliye Armstrong ho gaya.
</p><p>
  To put it shortly, it doesn't matter if women goes around forming covalent bonds with other men to complete their octets. But it is a damn issue of national security if you do the same. Then you are nothing better than Sodium for her.
</p><p>
  Feminism has become a fad more than a revolution. It is cool to be a feminist and you’re liberated only if you’re wearing the tiniest clothes, partying till late, being a rebel for no reason and working late hours in the office. And any woman who doesn’t fall into this particular definition of empowerment is looked at with either pity and sympathy or just hate. There are women who are housewives by choice (ask your mother if she is one), but most feminists fail to understand this.
</p><p>
  Pro Tip: There's nothing sexier than proper grammar.
</p><p>
  But believe me all you fine men wearing well tailored cut piece sexy suits, know your limits. Because this suit might be giving you utmost pride right now, but the only reason God even created men, was because he couldn't figure out how to make a vibrator for women who can also mow the lawn for them.
</p><p>
  Listen to me pal. She needs your strength, your firmness, your masculine energy to be unleashed in her at a cellular level and TAKE her beyond the point of no return and right into the heavens of rapture. Only at this level can she trust you as a man and allow herself once again to be seen. But don’t burn yourself to make her  feel warm.
</p><p>
  Love her as if she's the last glass of whiskey for the night. Pour her sweet. Hold her gentle. Look her close. Stir her some. Then kiss her deep.
</p><p>
  Long story short. The women of our country (even the feminist ones) are seriously under-fucked. The Men are evidently over-fucked. And we as a whole country are totally fucked. Brace thyselves for the fucking Epidemic !
